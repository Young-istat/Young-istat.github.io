      <description>The Young Statisticians’ Section of the Irish Statistical Association (Young-ISA) aims to create and cultivate a network of career-young statisticians across Ireland, statisticians in the early stages of their careers. The ISA established the Young-ISA to support social and professional opportunities for career-young statisticians within the ISA community.
The Young-ISA Section focuses on:
 Networking – Create and promote a network of career-young statisticians in Ireland. Young-ISA is a forum, for undergraduate and postgraduate students, researchers, lecturers and professionals, in all fields of Statistics, across academia, industry and other research institutions, to exchange and discuss ideas.</description>
