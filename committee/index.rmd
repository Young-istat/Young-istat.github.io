I obtained my PhD in Statistics from National University of Ireland, Galway after I had finished my Bachelor and Master degree in Statistics at the University of Tehran, Iran. Following my PhD, I joined the prostate cancer research group in UCD Conway Institute as a postdoctoral research fellow and worked on accurate grading and staging of prostate cancer. I am currently Lecturer in Statistics & Data Science in University of Limerick. My research interests include Survival analysis, Bayesian approach and Machine learning, in particular, their application in cancer research.

I am Davood Roshan, a *young* statistician and lecturer of Statistical Science at University of Galway. My primary research interest is in the longitudinal analysis of clinical biomarkers. In particular, I am interested in developing individualised and dynamic reference ranges for clinical biomarkers that are recorded longitudinally over time. My research domain includes but not limited to medicine, sport, engineering, finance and etc. I also have special interest in translational statistics, data visualisations and data science with a focus on developing predictive tools.

Hi! My name is Silvia and I am a lecturer in the School of Computer Science and Statistics, Trinity College Dublin. My research involves developing novel statistical methodology for various types of multidimensional data. I quite enjoy working on data-related problems and over the years I have had experience with many different types of data, such as social networks, metabolomic or genomic data. Outside of Statistics, I am a hiking and tag rugby enthusiast and enjoy every sort of outdoor activity. See my personal [webpage](https://silviadangelo.github.io/).

## <img src="pic_gabriel.png" width="180px" height="180px" align="left" style="margin:15px 20px 0px 0px"><a name="Gabriel"></a> Gabriel Rodriques Palma -- Website Manager
I graduated with first-class honours BSc in Biological Sciences from the University of São Paulo. Since starting my undergraduate degree, I have participated in several statistics, mathematical modelling, and machine learning projects. Thanks to these opportunities, I love being involved in multidisciplinary projects focusing on ecological and entomological research. I am a PhD researcher in Statistical Ecology at the Hamilton Institute of Maynooth University, funded by Science Foundation Ireland’s Centre for Research Training in Foundations of Data Science programme. My PhD project is “Statistical Modelling and machine learning applied to automating animal monitoring systems”. See my personal [webpage](https://gabrielrpalma.com).

I am Kate Finucane, a PhD researcher in the School of Mathematics and Statistics at University College Dublin. My research focuses on missing data imputation techniques using Bayesian methods, with applications to metabolomics. I hold a bachelor's degree in Physics and Astrophysics from Trinity College Dublin and a master's degree in Data and Computational Science from University College Dublin. I am also very passionate about scientific communication - I believe the public should be able to learn about the science they are funding! I am currently a producer of the Pint of Science Ireland podcast and have been involved in other podcasts, productions, and events in the past.

My name is Amir and I am a lecturer in Biostatistics in the School of Medicine at the University of Limerick. I am interested in statistical modelling, clinical decision-making, and transnational statistics. My research focuses on the application of statistical modelling and machine learning in cancer diagnostics and progression, particularly for prostate and breast cancers. I am also passionate about developing tools to facilitate the communication of statistical results to their target audience.
