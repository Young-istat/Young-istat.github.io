<p>The <strong>Young Statisticians’ Section of the</strong> <a href="https://istat.ie/"><strong>Irish Statistical Association</strong></a> (Young-ISA) aims to create and cultivate a network of career-young statisticians across Ireland, statisticians in the early stages of their careers. The ISA established the Young-ISA to support social and professional opportunities for career-young statisticians within the ISA community.</p>
<p>The Young-ISA Section focuses on:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Networking</strong> – <em>Create and promote a network of career-young statisticians in Ireland.</em> <br>
Young-ISA is a forum, for undergraduate and postgraduate students, researchers, lecturers and professionals, in all fields of Statistics, across academia, industry and other research institutions, to exchange and discuss ideas. Young-ISA provides an interface between career-young statisticians and the ISA.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Development</strong> – <em>Support the professional development of career-young statisticians.</em> <br>
In addition to promoting activities of the ISA and joint initiatives, the Young-ISA organises events, workshops and meetings. Young-ISA provides high-quality career guidance and information, and fosters a culture of interdisciplinary collaboration within its community.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Outreach</strong> – <em>Promote activities and prospects of a career in Statistics.</em> <br>
Young-ISA commits to raising awareness of the role of Statistics in modern day society. Young-ISA works with the ISA to advertise opportunities of the ISA and joint initiatives. Young-ISA shares news related to research topics, job opportunities and events of interest.</p></li>
