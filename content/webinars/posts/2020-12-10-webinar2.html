summary: Joshua Tobin from the School of Computer Science & Statistics, Trinity College Dublin, will introduce a new clustering method for large mixed attribute datasets which adapts and extends the popular peak-finding technique. The algorithm presented is competent at deciding the correct number of clusters and executes with subquadratic complexity.

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Clustering large, mixed data is a central problem in data mining. Many approaches adopt the idea of k-means, and hence are sensitive to initialisation, detect only spherical clusters, and require a priori the unknown number of clusters. We develop a new clustering algorithm for large data of mixed type, aiming at improving the applicability and efficiency of the peak-finding technique. The improvements are threefold: (1) the new algorithm is applicable to mixed data; (2) the algorithm is capable of detecting outliers and clusters of relatively lower density values; (3) the algorithm is competent at deciding the correct number of clusters. The computational complexity of the algorithm is greatly reduced by applying a fast k-nearest neighbours method and by scaling down to component sets. We present experimental results to verify that our algorithm works well in practice.</p>
