<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>There is a random variable (X) with a determined outcome (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(X = x_0\)</span>), <span class="math inline">\(p(x_0) = 1\)</span>.
Consider <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> to have a discrete uniform distribution over the integer interval <span class="math inline">\([1, s]\)</span>, where the
size of the sample space (s) = 1, in the initial state, such that <span class="math inline">\(p(x_0) = 1\)</span>. What is the
probability of <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> and the associated information entropy (<span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>), as <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> increases by expansion of
different functional forms? Such a process has been characterised in the case of (1) a monoexponential expansion of the sample space; (2) a power function expansion; (3) double
exponential expansion. What determines the different functional forms of the expansion of
the sample space with time is the functional relationship between time and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> (no. of sample
space doublings). If the expansion of the sample space occurred simultaneously via three (or
more) independent processes, of different functional forms, the combined overall process
can also be determined.</p>
<p>The methodology was applied to the expansion of the broad money supply of $US
over the period 2001-2019, as a real-world example of the mono-exponential expansion of
the sample space. At any given time, the information entropy is related to the rate at which
the sample space is expanding. In the context of the expansion of the broad money supply,
the information entropy could be considered to be related to the “velocity” of the
expansion of the money supply.</p>
<p>The double exponential expansion of the sample space with time describes a
“hyperinflationary” process. In terms of the fiat money supply, such an expansion would
lead to hyperinflation such that the “money” would become increasingly “worthless” with
time. Over the period from the middle of 1920 to the end of 1923, the purchasing power of
the Weimar Republic paper Mark to purchase one gold Mark became close to zero (1 paper
Mark = <span class="math inline">\(10^{-12}\)</span> gold Mark). From the purchasing power of the paper Mark to purchase one
gold Mark, the information entropy of this hyperinflationary process was determined.</p>
