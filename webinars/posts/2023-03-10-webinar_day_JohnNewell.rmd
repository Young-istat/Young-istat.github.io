John Newell is the Professor of Biostatistics in the School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences, University of Galway, an Adjunct Senior Research Fellow in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Canterbury, New Zealand and former Head of the Biostatistics Unit of the HRB Clinical Research Facility,  University of Galway. 

Prof. Newell is a member of the  University of Galway, [Health Data Science Research Cluster](https://sonrai.shinyapps.io/Sonrai_Research_Cluster/), a group of researchers and students interested in the development and application of statistical and computational methods to clinical and molecular biological data. His primary areas of research in Biostatistics are in the theory and application of statistical methods in clinical trials of health service and population health interventions and in the development of novel analytic approaches in Sports and Exercise Science. His research interests include statistical modelling, statistical computing, design and analysis of cluster randomised trials, smoothing techniques and derivative estimation, survival analysis, tree based classification problems and biostatistics in elite sports.


### Abstract
In this talk I will give a personal perspective on the different aspects of the word 'translation' with respect to the discipline of Statistics and the emergence of Health Data Science. 

Interesting collaborations will be presented involving combinations of small, narrow, tall and wide datasets all of which have an interesting aspect that was not apparent at the start.  These include alternative approaches to translate results from time to event problems such as mean residual life, permutation tests for paired survival problems and dynamic nomograms.
