---

**Date:** Friday April 19th, 2024 <br>
**Location:** Online <br>
**Time:** 9:30am - 12.00pm <br>
**Theme of the event:** Bayesian Statistics <br>

The **Young Statisticians' Section of the <a href="https://istat.ie/" target="_blank">Irish Statistical Association**</a> (Young-ISA) was formed in 2019 to create and cultivate a network of career-young statisticians across Ireland, supporting their professional development and providing a link to the Irish Statistical Association.</p>

We are thrilled to announce our joint webinar with the Bernoulli Society. The **Young-ISA webinar joint with Bernoulli Society on Bayesian Statistics** aims to bring together many career-young statisticians in Ireland to focus on the **application and theoretical development of Bayesian statistics**.

Our **keynote speaker** is [Prof. Claire Gormley](https://people.ucd.ie/claire.gormley) from the University College Dublin. [Prof. Claire Gormley](https://people.ucd.ie/claire.gormley) will bring insights into the Bayesian nonparametric modelling of network data and describe a new method, the latent shrinkage position model (LSPM). Also, we will have three invited speakers, including [Dr. Matteo Giordano](https://matteogiordano.weebly.com/), an Assistant Professor in statistics at the University of  Turin, [Dr. Maeve Upton](https://www.ul.ie/research/dr-maeve-upton), a postdoctoral researcher in Statistical modelling at the University of Limerick, and [Yong Chen Goh](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/hamilton/our-people/yong-chen-goh), PhD student in Statistics at Maynooth University, who will discuss some of their experience working with Bayesian statistics.
