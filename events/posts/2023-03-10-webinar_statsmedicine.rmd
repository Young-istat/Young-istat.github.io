The **Young Statisticians' Section of the <a href="https://istat.ie/" target="_blank">Irish Statistical Association**</a> (Young-ISA) was formed in 2019 with the objectives of creating and cultivating a network of career-young statisticians across Ireland, supporting their professional development and providing a link to the Irish Statistical Association.</p>

Our **Young-ISA online workshop on Statistics in Medicine** is an event that has emerged from our [monthly webinar series](/webinars) and aims to bring together many career-young statisticians in Ireland to focus on **application of statistical science in medicine**. 

Our **keynote speaker** will be [Prof. John Newell](https://www.universityofgalway.ie/our-research/people/mathematics-statistics-and-applied-mathematics/johnnewell/) from University of Galway. [Prof. John Newell](https://www.universityofgalway.ie/our-research/people/mathematics-statistics-and-applied-mathematics/johnnewell/) will walk us through his more than 20 years of experience in development and application of biostatistical theory in clinical trials, observational clinical research, Sports and Exercise Science and in the emerging field of Translational Statistics.

Further, we will have two invited talks from [Dr. Arthur White](https://www.tcd.ie/research/profiles/?profile=arwhite), Assistant Professor in Statistics at Trinity College Dublin, and [Koyel Majumdar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/koyel-majumdar-0b261b154/?originalSubdomain=ie), PhD student in Statistics at University College Dublin, who are going to discuss some of their experience working with applications in medicine.
