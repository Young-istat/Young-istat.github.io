**Date:** Monday December 9th, 2024 <br>
**Location:** [UCD O'Brien Centre for Science](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5tHkKHTLYWoRCDEx6), University College Dublin (UCD) <br>
**Time:** 9 am - 5 pm GMT <br>
**Theme of the event:** Transferable Skills: Insights from Academia and Industry <br>

The **Young Statisticians' Section of the <a href="https://istat.ie/" target="_blank">Irish Statistical Association**</a> (Young-ISA) was formed in 2019 with the objectives of creating and cultivating a network of career-young statisticians across Ireland, supporting their professional development and providing a link to the Irish Statistical Association.</p>

This event is the 5th Young-ISA meeting that will bring together many career-young statisticians in Ireland to focus on **Transferable Skills: Insights from Academia and Industry**. This event offers early career researchers and PhD students an excellent opportunity to gain insights into advancing their careers in academia. We will host **three keynote talks** where keynote speakers will share their perspectives on crucial aspects of this journey.

There will also be a series of short research talks delivered by career-young researchers from different Irish universities, as well as a round table discussion with our keynote speakers on the theme of the event, with the opportunity for audience questions.

The event also dedicates one of its afternoon session to a joint event organised by Young-ISA and The [British  and Irish Region (BIR) of the International Biometric Society (IBS)](https://bir.biometricsociety.org/home), featuring two talks by early-career researchers from both Young-ISA ad BIR.  

**The winners of our next Young-ISA Twitter Poster Conference (stay tuned) will be announced at this event.** Please check [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSef3Lh_q-JzQReItGDUazGadZ1vJBEYPn8Z9zbTlmLo0RPE-A/viewform) for more detail on how to participate.
